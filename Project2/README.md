# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzed crime data in Boston to indentify trends and patterns in offesnses over time. Using data visualisation and exploratory data analysis techniques the aim of the project is to highlight different analysis insights that could aid in better resource allocatin and efficent crime prevention strategies
