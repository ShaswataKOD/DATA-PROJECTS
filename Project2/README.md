# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzed crime data in Boston to indentify trends and patterns in offesnses over time. Using data visualisation and exploratory data analysis techniques the aim of the project is to highlight different analysis insights that could aid in better resource allocatin and efficent crime prevention strategies
## Dataset used - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston)
  1. *Crime Dataset* - Provides records of offenses including the types,dates,location
  2. *Offense Code Dataset* - Maps codes to their description enabling categorization of crimes
## Data Definition -
  * approximately there are 5 lakh rows and 10 columns
  * encoding format = 'ISO-8000"
## Preprocessing -
1) Handling Null and Duplicate Values and -
  * percentage of null values in the total dataset were less than 5 percent;rows were dropped
  * 2 columns were almost null so was dropped
  * 23 rows were found duplicate which were also dropped
2)  Data Integration -
  * datasets were merged to create a single large dataset
## Further Insights -
  1) Evening Crime Patterns: Crimes are more frequently committed in the evening hours compared to other times of day, indicating a potential peak 
     period for criminal activity.
  2) Yearly Crime Trends: Total recorded crimes were notably higher in 2016 and 2017, suggesting these years experienced elevated crime rates or 
     improved reporting.
  3) Weekend Night Crimes: Nighttime crimes are more prevalent on weekends than on weekdays, highlighting a possible link between weekend     
     activities and increased criminal incidents.     
## Conclusion and Recommendations -
  * Potential for building predictive model to predict crime based on historical data
  * Integrating datasets like socio-econoic and demographic data could possibly enhance anaysis
