### 🎯 Objectives
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify high-value customers using revenue contribution, purchase frequency, and average order value (AOV).
2. **Behavioral Analysis:** Categorize customers into loyal, new, and inactive segments using RFM Analysis.
3. **Seasonality Analysis:** Identify sales peaks and fluctuations in revenue and AOV. 📅
